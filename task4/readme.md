                                          Terraform Multi-Tier AWS Architecture Documentation

This project is meant to deploy a secure, highly available, and scalable multi-tier application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Terraform. The architecture is modular, so managing, extending, and reusing components becomes a trivial task. What follows is an in-depth description of the structure of the project, modules, configuration, usage, and best practice.

Overview
The goal of this project is to automate the deployment of a typical web application stack on AWS. The stack includes:

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation.

Public and private subnets in each Availability Zone (AZ) for different application tiers.

Internet and NAT gateways to enable secure inbound and outbound traffic.

Security groups to control access to each tier.

Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Launch Templates for web (frontend) and app (backend) servers.

Application Load Balancers (ALB) to load balance traffic to web and app servers.

RDS database for storing data, located in private subnets for security.

This configuration is for high availability, scalability, and security of your application.

Project Structure
The project has a root directory and a number of module directories. The modules handle a particular section of the infrastructure.

Module Descriptions
VPC Module:

Deploys a VPC with a given CIDR block.

Deploys public web tier subnets, app tier private subnets, and database tier private subnets, each in each of the given Availability Zones.

Exports the VPC ID and subnet IDs for other modules to use.

Networking Module:

Deploys an Internet Gateway and associates it with the VPC.

Deploys Elastic IPs and NAT Gateways in every public subnet.

Creates route tables for public and private subnets.

Maps subnets to corresponding route tables.

Outputs gateway and route table IDs.

Security Module:

Generates security groups for the web, app, and database tiers.

Web security group permits HTTP/HTTPS from anywhere.

App security group permits traffic from the web security group.

Database security group permits traffic from the app security group.

Outputs security group IDs.

Compute Module:

Generates launch templates for web and app servers.

Creates Auto Scaling Groups for web and app servers and puts them in the correct subnets.

Creates target groups for the ALBs.

Outputs target group ARNs for use in ALB configuration.

ALB Module:

Creates a public ALB for the web tier and a private ALB for the app tier.

Configures HTTP and HTTPS listeners (HTTPS needs a certificate).

Links target groups to the ALBs.

Outputs ALB DNS names and ARNs.

RDS Module:

Creates a subnet group for the database.

Provides an RDS instance in private database subnets.

Configures database engine, version, credentials, and storage.

Prints the RDS endpoint and username.

Configuration Files
main.tf:

Invokes all modules in the right order.

Passes necessary variables from one module to another.

Manages the dependencies (e.g., VPC ID, subnet IDs, security group IDs).

variables.tf:

Specifies all input variables for the root module.

Contains defaults for region, VPC CIDR, AZ count, instance type, etc.

Manages sensitive variables such as the database password.

outputs.tf:

Exports primary outputs like VPC ID, subnet IDs, ALB DNS names, and RDS endpoint.

Flags sensitive outputs to secure them in logs.

terrafrom.tfvars:

Provides variable values for the deployment (region, CIDR, AMI, key name, etc.).

May be used for sensitive values, but environment variables are advised for production.

providers.tf:

Specifies the AWS provider and minimum Terraform version.

May add backend configuration for remote state storage.

Usage Instructions
Initialize the Project: Execute terraform init to fetch necessary providers and modules.

Set Required Variables:

Modify terraform.tfvars for the majority of settings.

For sensitive information such as the database password, utilize environment variables:
text export TF_VAR_db_password="your-strong-password" Or define it in terraform.tfvars (not advisable for production secrets).

Plan the Deployment: Execute terraform plan to preview the changes which will be applied.

Apply the Configuration: Execute terraform apply to provision the infrastructure. Approve the changes if asked.

Review Outputs:

Once apply is used, Terraform will print outputs including ALB DNS names and RDS endpoint.

Sensitive outputs such as RDS endpoint and username are obfuscated.

Best Practices
Modularity:

Every unit is its own module, which makes the code reusable and simple to maintain.

Sensitive Data:

Utilize environment variables or secrets management for passwords and other sensitive information.

State Management:

Keep Terraform state safely, ideally on a remote backend such as S3.

Security

Put databases in private subnets and limit access with security groups.

Tagging:

Regularly tag all resources for cost monitoring and operational control.

Example Outputs
Upon deployment, Terraform will provide outputs like:
web_alb_dns_name = "web-alb-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
app_alb_dns_name = "app-alb-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
rds_endpoint =
These can be used to access your database and application.

Troubleshooting
Missing Variables:

If Terraform asks for a variable (i.e., db_password), make sure it is defined in variables.tf and configured in terraform.tfvars or as an environment variable.

Module Errors:

Verify that all the arguments required are passed to every module in main.tf.

Provider Errors:

Make sure that the AWS provider is correctly configured with the proper region and credentials.

Summary
This Terraform solution offers a solid, modular, and secure starting point to deploy a multi-tier application on AWS. It creates all infrastructure components needed automatically, such as networking, security, compute, load balancer, and database resources. Through the given structure and best practices, you can efficiently manage, scale, and secure your application environment.
